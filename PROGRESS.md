## üéØ Current Focus

**Active Task**: Task 3 ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Next Up**: Task 4 - Budget Calculation Engine

**Blockers**: None - ready to proceed

## üìù Notes

### Database Schema Highlights
- Uses UUID for all primary keys
- Proper foreign key relationships with cascade deletes
- Indexes on frequently queried columns (userId, date, categoryId)
- Decimal type for currency (no floating point errors)
- Soft delete pattern for categories (isActive flag)

### Design Decisions
- PostgreSQL chosen for robust transaction support
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Weekly budgets stored as separate records (not calculated on-the-fly)
- Carryover tracked in dedicated table for audit trail
- Achievement system built for gamification

### Technical Debt
- None yet - clean start

### Future Considerations
- Add database connection pooling for production
- Implement database backups
- Consider read replicas for scaling
- Add database monitoring
- Implement soft deletes for transactions (currently hard delete)

## üöÄ How to Continue

To continue implementation:

1. **Review the spec**: Read `.kiro/specs/smart-weekly-budget-coach/requirements.md` and `design.md`

2. **Set up your environment**: Follow `INSTALLATION.md` to install dependencies and set up the database

3. **Start Task 2**: Begin implementing CSV upload functionality
   - Create `src/services/CSVParserService.ts`
   - Build `src/components/CSVUpload.tsx`
   - Add API route `src/app/api/csv-upload/route.ts`

4. **Test as you go**: Use Prisma Studio to verify data is being saved correctly

5. **Commit frequently**: Keep commits small and focused on specific features
