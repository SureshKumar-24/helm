# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Weekly Budget Coach is a foundational feature of Financial Helm that helps users understand exactly how much they can spend each week on individual spending categories (e.g., Food Delivery, Shopping, Entertainment). This feature addresses the core problem of "blind spending" anxiety by providing clear, actionable weekly spending limits with intelligent carryover tracking and real-time updates.

Unlike traditional monthly budgets that feel abstract and distant, the Smart Weekly Budget Coach breaks down spending into manageable weekly chunks, making it easier for users to stay on track. The system intelligently handles unspent amounts by rolling them forward (positive accumulation) and triggers supportive recovery plans when users overspend, all delivered through empathetic, non-judgmental messaging.

This feature serves as the foundation for other Financial Helm features, providing the baseline data for Weekly Motivational Checks, Major Expense Forecasts, and Predictive Notifications.
