# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality in the Financial Helm Next.js application. The PWA implementation will enable users to install the application on their Android and iOS devices, providing a native app-like experience with offline capabilities, push notifications support, and home screen installation.

## Glossary

- **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: A web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users
- **Service Worker**: A script that runs in the background, enabling offline functionality and push notifications
- **Web App Manifest**: A JSON file that provides metadata about the web application for installation
- **Financial Helm Application**: The Next.js-based personal finance management web application
- **Install Prompt**: A browser-native UI element that allows users to add the PWA to their device home screen
- **Offline Mode**: The ability for the application to function without an active internet connection
- **Cache Strategy**: The method used to store and retrieve resources for offline access
- **App Icon**: Visual identifier displayed on the device home screen and in the app switcher
- **Splash Screen**: A screen displayed while the PWA is loading on mobile devices
- **Standalone Mode**: Display mode where the PWA runs in its own window without browser UI elements
